We're thrilled to announce that LocaleNLP now fully supports Swahili (Kiswahili), one of Africa's most widely spoken languages. This marks a significant milestone in our mission to break down language barriers across the continent.

## Why Swahili?

Swahili serves as a lingua franca for over 100 million people across East Africa, including:

- Tanzania
- Kenya
- Uganda
- Rwanda
- Burundi
- Democratic Republic of the Congo

```typescript
// Example usage of our Swahili translation API
const translation = await localenlp.translate({
  text: "Hello, how are you?",
  from: "en",
  to: "sw"
});

console.log(translation.text); // "Habari, u hali gani?"
```

## Technical Improvements

Our new Swahili model achieves:

- 95% accuracy on common phrases
- Support for multiple dialects
- Real-time translation capabilities
- Contextual understanding

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning of our expansion into East African languages. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve and expand our language support.
